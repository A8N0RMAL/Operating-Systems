- Operating systems are an essential part of any computer system. Similarly, a course on operating systems is an essential part of any Computer Science as well as Electronics course. This field is undergoing rapid change, as computers are now prevalent in virtually every application. Yet the fundamental concepts remain fairly clear and that is what will be taught in this course.
In brief, an operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and the computer hardware. The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner. 
Every important aspects of an Operating System will be taught in this course so as to get a proper understanding about Operating Systems and their design and working.

###  Introduction to OS
- An Operating System (OS) is a program that manages the computer hardware.
- It also provides a basis for Application Programs and acts as an intermediary between computer User and compter Hardware.
- Examples of widely used OS include Windows, Linux, Ubuntu, macOS, iOS, and Android. This lecture aims to provide an overview of what an OS is, its functions, and its various types.

- The computer system comprises several components: at the base level is hardware including the CPU, memory (RAM and ROM), and I/O devices such as keyboards and monitors. The Operating System (OS) sits above the hardware, managing resources and providing a platform for system and application software.
- System software operates directly on the hardware, while application software runs on top of the OS.
- This structure illustrates how the OS interacts with both hardware and software to facilitate computing tasks.

- System software, including the Operating System (OS), manages computer hardware and enables system operations, while application programs are designed for end-user tasks.
- Examples of application programs include word processors like Microsoft Office Word, spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel, compilers for code writing, text editors like Notepad, and web browsers like Google Chrome. These programs perform specific functions and are used directly by users to accomplish various tasks.
- Without an Operating System (OS), users would have to communicate directly with computer hardware for every task, which involves complex coding for actions like opening applications, typing, displaying text, and saving files. This would make even simple tasks cumbersome and impractical.
- The OS acts as an intermediary, simplifying interactions between users and hardware by managing these tasks and allowing users to perform actions more intuitively, such as double-clicking an application icon to start a program.
- The Operating System (OS) simplifies user interaction with computer hardware by handling all underlying tasks. When a user performs actions like typing or saving a document, the OS manages these operations behind the scenes, including opening applications, displaying text, and allocating memory. This allows users to focus on their tasks without needing to manually code every interaction with the hardware. Essentially, the OS acts as an intermediary, making computing easier and more accessible by managing complex hardware interactions.

- Operating systems (OS) serve as intermediaries between users and hardware, facilitating seamless computing experiences.
- Key types of OS include batch, time-sharing, distributed, network, real-time, and multi-tasking systems, each designed for specific needs.
- The main functions of an OS include acting as an interface between users and hardware, and allocating resources like the CPU and memory. Understanding these types and functions provides a foundation for exploring how different OS designs cater to various computing requirements.
- Operating systems (OS) are crucial for managing computer resources, including memory and input-output devices. They allocate resources efficiently to users and processes, ensuring that limited hardware is utilized effectively. Key functions include managing memory, ensuring security, and facilitating resource allocation. The primary goal of an OS is to provide convenience by simplifying user interactions with hardware, making computing tasks more manageable and less tedious.
- Efficiency in operating systems involves the effective management of computer resources, ensuring that all users receive appropriate amounts of resources without manual intervention. An OS handles the allocation of resources and management of memory, which is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and avoiding wastage. By automating these tasks, the OS enhances system efficiency, balancing the needs of multiple users and processes effectively. This goal complements the OS's role in providing convenience and is central to its overall design and functionality.
