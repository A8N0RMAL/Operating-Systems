###  Introduction to OS
- An Operating System (OS) is a program that manages the computer hardware.
- It also provides a basis for Application Programs and acts as an intermediary between computer User and compter Hardware.
- Examples of widely used OS include Windows, Linux, Ubuntu, macOS, iOS, and Android. Let's take an overview of what an OS is, its functions, and its various types.

- The computer system comprises several components: at the base level is hardware including the CPU, memory (RAM and ROM), and I/O devices such as keyboards and monitors. The Operating System (OS) sits above the hardware, managing resources and providing a platform for system and application software.
- System software operates directly on the hardware, while application software runs on top of the OS.
- This structure illustrates how the OS interacts with both hardware and software to facilitate computing tasks.

- System software, including the Operating System (OS), manages computer hardware and enables system operations, while application programs are designed for end-user tasks.
- Examples of application programs include word processors like Microsoft Office Word, spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel, compilers for code writing, text editors like Notepad, and web browsers like Google Chrome. These programs perform specific functions and are used directly by users to accomplish various tasks.
- Without an Operating System (OS), users would have to communicate directly with computer hardware for every task, which involves complex coding for actions like opening applications, typing, displaying text, and saving files. This would make even simple tasks cumbersome and impractical.
- The OS acts as an intermediary, simplifying interactions between users and hardware by managing these tasks and allowing users to perform actions more intuitively, such as double-clicking an application icon to start a program.
- The Operating System (OS) simplifies user interaction with computer hardware by handling all underlying tasks. When a user performs actions like typing or saving a document, the OS manages these operations behind the scenes, including opening applications, displaying text, and allocating memory. This allows users to focus on their tasks without needing to manually code every interaction with the hardware. Essentially, the OS acts as an intermediary, making computing easier and more accessible by managing complex hardware interactions.

- Operating systems (OS) serve as intermediaries between users and hardware, facilitating seamless computing experiences.
- Key types of OS include batch, time-sharing, distributed, network, real-time, and multi-tasking systems, each designed for specific needs.
- The main functions of an OS include acting as an interface between users and hardware, and allocating resources like the CPU and memory. Understanding these types and functions provides a foundation for exploring how different OS designs cater to various computing requirements.
- Operating systems (OS) are crucial for managing computer resources, including memory and input-output devices. They allocate resources efficiently to users and processes, ensuring that limited hardware is utilized effectively. Key functions include managing memory, ensuring security, and facilitating resource allocation. The primary goal of an OS is to provide convenience by simplifying user interactions with hardware, making computing tasks more manageable and less tedious.
- Efficiency in operating systems involves the effective management of computer resources, ensuring that all users receive appropriate amounts of resources without manual intervention. An OS handles the allocation of resources and management of memory, which is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and avoiding wastage. By automating these tasks, the OS enhances system efficiency, balancing the needs of multiple users and processes effectively. This goal complements the OS's role in providing convenience and is central to its overall design and functionality.

#### Basics of OS (Computer System Operation)
##### Some basic knowledge of the structure of Computer System is required to understand how Operating Systems work.
- A modern general-purpose computer system consists of one or more CPUs and a number of device controllers connected through a common bus that provides access to shared memory.

##### Undertanding the role of CPUs in modern computer systems
- A modern computer system typically includes one or more central processing units (CPUs), which are crucial for performing all computational tasks.
- The CPU, often confused with the entire computer case, is actually a small chip embedded in the motherboard responsible for calculations and processing.
- The system may also contain various device controllers connected through a common bus to manage hardware components like disks, keyboards, and printers, all of which interact with the CPU to perform their functions.

##### How Device Controllers Manage Hardware and Memory Access
- Device controllers, such as USB controllers for peripherals and video adapters for displays, manage specific hardware components by regulating their operation.
- These controllers, along with the CPU, are connected through a common bus to shared memory.
- This shared memory, often RAM, is finite and must be managed carefully as both the CPU and device controllers can compete for access to it.
- Each controller is responsible for ensuring the proper functioning of its respective device while interfacing with the shared memory through the common bus.

##### The Role of Memory Controllers in Concurrent Device Operations
- To handle multiple device operations simultaneously without lag, a memory controller is used to synchronize access to the main memory.
- When devices such as disk controllers and input peripherals operate concurrently, they all need to access the shared memory for execution.
- The memory controller ensures that each device and the CPU get their required share of memory, managing access efficiently to prevent conflicts and maintain smooth operation across all devices.

##### The Role and Function of the Bootstrap Program in System Startup
- The bootstrap program, also known as the bootloader, is the first program executed when a computer is powered on or rebooted. Stored in ROM (Read Only Memory).
- It initializes the system by loading the operating system from secondary memory into the main memory.
- This program is essential for starting the operating system and facilitating the interaction between the user and the computer's hardware, ensuring that the system boots up properly and is ready for use.

##### The Bootstrap Program's Role in Loading the OS Kernel
- The bootstrap program is responsible for initiating the computer system by locating and loading the operating system's kernel into the main memory.
- The kernel, which is the core component of the operating system, must be loaded for the OS to become operational.
- This process occurs immediately when the computer is powered on, ensuring that the system is prepared for further operations and management by the operating system.

##### Understanding the Role of Interrupts in CPU Operations
- Interrupts are signals sent by hardware or software to the CPU, requesting it to halt its current task and address a more urgent one.
- This mechanism allows the CPU to manage multiple tasks efficiently by pausing ongoing processes to handle higher-priority operations.
- Interrupts ensure that critical tasks are addressed promptly, maintaining the system's responsiveness and functionality.

##### Understanding System Calls and Their Function
- System calls, also known as monitor calls, are special operations triggered by software that cause an interrupt in the CPU. Unlike hardware interrupts, which come from external devices, system calls originate from within the software. When a system call is made, it interrupts the CPU's current task and transfers execution to a predefined location where the service routine for the call is executed, allowing the system to handle specific requests or operations.
